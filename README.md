    Thank you for taking the Vine personality quiz! There are many like it, but this one is yours.
    -There are two ways to take this quiz: Either by going into this workspace and using `flask run`, or by visiting the link at http://ide50-gcpasco.cs50.io:8080/form.
    -From there, using the program is simple: Answer the questions as honestly as possible.
        -Also, answer all the questions, since the program will yell at you if you don't. You don't want that weighing on you.
    -If you're really bored, just watch the mesmerizing color change of the background as it slowly engulfs your soul.
    -Once you get the result, you have the option to tweet out the Vine that fits you as a person. We highly recommend this, as it was specifically chosen for you (and as such, is a perfect window to your soul). Simply click the Tweet button, log into Twitter, and let the quiz do the rest.
    -To take the quiz again, click on the "CS50 Project" section in the top left corner.
    -We hope you enjoy our quiz and embrace the Vine selected for you with pride.

    Peace, love, and Vines,
    Aaron Hai and Paolo Pasco
